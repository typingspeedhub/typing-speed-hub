  <h1>7-Day Typing Practice Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Ready to improve your typing skills in just one week?</strong> This step-by-step plan is designed to help you build accuracy, speed, and confidence through daily practice.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Day 1 – Mastering the Home Row</h2>
    <p>Focus on finger placement. Use beginner drills to practice the <strong>ASDF JKL;</strong> keys without looking. Build muscle memory from the ground up.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Sit straight, relax your wrists, and keep your fingers lightly on the keys.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Day 2 – Introducing the Top and Bottom Rows</h2>
    <p>Add the top row (QWERTYUIOP) and bottom row (ZXCVBNM) keys. Practice transitions between rows while maintaining accuracy.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don’t rush. Focus on steady rhythm over speed.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Day 3 – Typing Short Sentences</h2>
    <p>Practice short, real-world sentences using all letter keys. Accuracy is still more important than speed.</p>
    <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Small wins today build momentum for tomorrow.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Day 4 – Increasing Speed with Repetition</h2>
    <p>Use timed exercises (1-3 minutes) to build speed. Repeat challenging words until they become effortless.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use typing tools or games that measure your Words Per Minute (WPM).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Day 5 – Real-World Practice</h2>
    <p>Type emails, notes, or articles. Avoid copy-pasting—type everything manually. This simulates actual use and improves fluency.</p>
    <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> You’re more than halfway there—keep pushing!</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Day 6 – Typing Under Pressure</h2>
    <p>Try typing with a timer or while multitasking. Practice focus and accuracy under light stress, like background noise or music.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Stay calm. Mistakes are part of the learning process.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Day 7 – Full Practice and Reflection</h2>
    <p>Take a 5-minute typing test. Compare your WPM and accuracy with Day 1. Reflect on your progress and celebrate your effort!</p>
    <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> You’ve built a new habit in just 7 days. Keep going!</p>
