  <h1>7-Day Typing Plan: Boost Your Speed and Accuracy</h1>

  <p>
    Want to type faster and more accurately without turning practice into a full-time job? This <strong>7-day typing plan</strong> gives you a clear,
    beginner-friendly routine that also scales to intermediate and advanced typists. Each day has a focused goal: technique, accuracy, speed bursts,
    and real-world typing — so you improve <strong>WPM</strong> and <strong>accuracy</strong> together.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’re new to typing metrics, start here first: <a href="what-is-wpm.html">What is WPM?</a>. Then use our
    <a href="index.html">Typing Speed Test</a> to measure your baseline before Day 1.
  </p>

  <div class="cta-box" aria-label="Quick action">
    <strong>Quick action:</strong>
    Take a 1-minute <a href="index.html">Typing Speed Test</a> now, then follow the plan for 7 days and compare your Day 1 vs Day 7 results (WPM + accuracy).
  </div>

  <h2>✅ Before You Start: 3 Rules That Make This Plan Work</h2>

  <div class="step">
    <h3>1) Accuracy comes first</h3>
    <p>
      If you push speed too early, you train mistakes. Aim for <strong>95%+ accuracy</strong> as your default. Speed increases naturally when your hands
      stop hesitating.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h3>2) Practice short, but daily</h3>
    <p>
      Ten focused minutes per day beats one long session per week. If you want a ready-made daily routine, combine this plan with our
      <a href="10-minute-typing-drill.html">10-Minute Typing Drill</a>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h3>3) Track WPM and accuracy together</h3>
    <p>
      WPM without accuracy is meaningless. Record both each day. Your goal is stable accuracy while WPM gradually rises.
      (On your homepage, you can already track results in the table after each test.)
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>📅 The 7-Day Typing Plan</h2>

  <div class="step">
    <h3>Day 1 — Home Row Fundamentals</h3>
    <p>
      The home row is the foundation of touch typing: <code>ASDF</code> for the left hand and <code>JKL;</code> for the right.
      Keep your fingers resting here after every movement.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Warm-up: type <code>asdf jkl;</code> slowly for 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Accuracy drill: type short words and focus on zero mistakes.</li>
      <li>1-minute test: take one baseline test on <a href="index.html">Typing Speed Test</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Learn proper finger positioning and reduce looking at the keyboard.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h3>Day 2 — Reach the Top and Bottom Rows</h3>
    <p>
      Expand from home row to the full keyboard. This is where most beginners lose accuracy because fingers “hunt” for keys.
      Move slowly and return to home row every time.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Practice top row patterns (e.g., <code>qwer</code>, <code>uiop</code>).</li>
      <li>Practice bottom row patterns (e.g., <code>zxcv</code>, <code>bnm</code>).</li>
      <li>Do a 3-minute accuracy session: slow typing, perfect form.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Improve control and reduce finger confusion.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h3>Day 3 — Real Sentences + Punctuation</h3>
    <p>
      Now you’re training real typing: sentences, capitalization, and punctuation. This builds rhythm and reduces “stop-start” typing.
      If punctuation causes mistakes, slow down and focus on clean input.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Type 5–10 real sentences without rushing.</li>
      <li>Add punctuation (comma, period) and capitalization.</li>
      <li>Use the <a href="10-minute-typing-drill.html">10-Minute Typing Drill</a> structure if you want guidance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Maintain accuracy while typing natural text.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h3>Day 4 — Timed Tests (Speed Day)</h3>
    <p>
      Day 4 is about controlled speed. Your job is to push slightly beyond comfort while keeping accuracy reasonable.
      Don’t chase your best score — chase consistency.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Run three 1-minute tests with short breaks.</li>
      <li>Write down WPM + accuracy for each run.</li>
      <li>Compare: are you fast but inaccurate, or accurate but slow?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you want speed + technique tips, see: <a href="typing-tips.html">Typing tips</a> and
      <a href="typing-accuracy-tips.html">Typing Accuracy Tips</a>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Increase WPM without breaking accuracy habits.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
  <h3>Day 5 — Real-World Application</h3>

  <p>
    Typing tests are great, but real typing is different. Today you practice “useful typing”: emails, notes, short articles, or copying text manually.
    This improves endurance and fluency.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using a comfortable keyboard with good key travel can reduce finger strain during longer practice sessions.
    If you’re curious, see our guide:
    <a href="best-keyboards-typing-practice.html">Best Keyboards for Typing Practice</a>.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Type a short paragraph from an article (no copy/paste).</li>
    <li>Write 5–10 sentences from your own thoughts.</li>
    <li>Focus on smooth rhythm and clean accuracy.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Build confidence and reduce fatigue in everyday typing.</p>
</div>


  <div class="step">
    <h3>Day 6 — Error Resistance (Practice Under Mild Distraction)</h3>
    <p>
      Real life is noisy: notifications, music, multitasking. Today you train staying accurate even when conditions aren’t perfect.
      Keep distractions mild — the goal isn’t chaos, it’s stability.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Play light background music or set a timer.</li>
      <li>Do 5 minutes of sentence typing with a focus on accuracy.</li>
      <li>Do one 1-minute test and compare accuracy to Day 4.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Many mistakes come from habits like looking down, rushing, or using the wrong fingers. If you notice patterns, read:
      <a href="common-typing-mistakes.html">Common typing mistakes</a>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Stay calm, keep rhythm, reduce mistakes under pressure.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h3>Day 7 — Final Test + Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      Today you measure progress. Repeat the same test conditions from Day 1 (same duration and similar difficulty) and compare results honestly.
      The biggest win is usually better accuracy and smoother typing — speed often follows.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do one 1-minute test and one 5-minute test (if available).</li>
      <li>Compare Day 1 vs Day 7: WPM, accuracy, and comfort.</li>
      <li>Pick 1 focus area for next week (accuracy, punctuation, speed bursts, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Confirm progress and choose a next-step routine.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>📈 What Results Should You Expect After 7 Days?</h2>

  <div class="step">
    <p>Results vary, but most people see improvements quickly when practice is consistent:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Beginners:</strong> fewer mistakes, more confidence, +3 to +10 WPM is common.</li>
      <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> more stable accuracy, +2 to +7 WPM with better rhythm.</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> fewer “dips” in performance, improved endurance and consistency.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Even if your WPM doesn’t jump dramatically, better accuracy and smoother typing are strong signs that speed will increase over the next 2–4 weeks.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>🧠 Common Problems (and Quick Fixes)</h2>

  <div class="step">
    <h3>“My WPM goes up but accuracy drops.”</h3>
    <p>
      Slow down slightly and aim for 95%+ accuracy for two days. Then push speed again.
      Accuracy is the base that supports speed.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h3>“I keep looking at the keyboard.”</h3>
    <p>
      Cover your hands with a light cloth or lower the brightness of your keyboard lights. The discomfort of not looking is temporary —
      muscle memory grows fast with repetition.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="step">
    <h3>“I feel stuck at the same speed.”</h3>
    <p>
      Switch practice style: add typing games, new sentence types, or new difficulty levels. Try:
      <a href="best-free-typing-games.html">Best free typing games</a>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <section class="faq" aria-label="FAQ">
    <h2>FAQ: 7-Day Typing Plan</h2>

    <h3>How long should I practice each day on this plan?</h3>
    <p>Most people see progress with 10–20 minutes per day. Short, consistent sessions work better than long, irregular practice.</p>

    <h3>Should I focus on speed or accuracy first?</h3>
    <p>Accuracy first. Aim for 95%+ accuracy during most practice. Once accuracy is stable, your WPM rises naturally.</p>

    <h3>What results can I expect after 7 days?</h3>
    <p>Many beginners reduce mistakes quickly and often improve by about 3–10 WPM. Intermediate users typically see steadier accuracy and a smaller WPM increase with better rhythm.</p>

    <h3>What if my WPM improves but my accuracy drops?</h3>
    <p>Slow down slightly and prioritize accuracy for a couple of days (95%+). Then push speed again. Speed without accuracy reinforces mistakes.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>➡️ Next Steps After the 7-Day Challenge</h2>

  <div class="step">
    <ul>
      <li>Repeat this plan for another week and aim for higher consistency.</li>
      <li>Use the <a href="10-minute-typing-drill.html">10-Minute Typing Drill</a> daily for ongoing improvement.</li>
      <li>Work on technique and habits with <a href="typing-tips.html">Typing tips</a>.</li>
      <li>Fix performance blockers using <a href="common-typing-mistakes.html">Common typing mistakes</a>.</li>
      <li>Track progress regularly with the <a href="index.html">Typing Speed Test</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you want a longer challenge, you can also build toward bigger goals like “60 WPM with 97% accuracy” over the next month.
      Small improvements add up fast when practice stays consistent.
