  <h1>7-Day Typing Plan: Boost Your Speed and Accuracy</h1>
  <p><strong>Want to type faster and more accurately?</strong> This 7-day typing practice routine helps you build essential skills with a clear step-by-step approach. Perfect for beginners, students, professionals, and anyone who wants to improve typing efficiency.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Day 1 – Learn Home Row Basics</h2>
    <p>Start with the foundation: <strong>ASDF JKL;</strong>. These are your home keys. Practice finger positioning without looking. Build muscle memory through slow, deliberate repetition.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Sit up straight, keep your wrists relaxed, and always return fingers to the home position.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Day 2 – Master the Full Keyboard</h2>
    <p>Expand your reach to the top (QWERTYUIOP) and bottom (ZXCVBNM) rows. Combine keys into short exercises to improve finger agility.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Practice in short intervals and don’t rush. Focus on accuracy before speed.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Day 3 – Practice Typing Real Sentences</h2>
    <p>Use everyday phrases and short paragraphs. Incorporate punctuation and capitalization. Try our <a href="10-minute-typing-drill.html">10-minute typing drill</a> for focused practice.</p>
    <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Mistakes are part of progress. Aim for fewer errors, not perfection.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Day 4 – Build Typing Speed with Timed Tests</h2>
    <p>Take 1- to 3-minute typing speed tests. Track your Words Per Minute (WPM) daily and challenge yourself to improve gradually.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use tools that show accuracy along with WPM, and avoid rushing through mistakes.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Day 5 – Real-World Application</h2>
    <p>Type out emails, notes, blog posts, or even copy paragraphs from articles. Avoid copy-paste — this is about real muscle training.</p>
    <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Each word you type manually builds speed and confidence.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Day 6 – Typing Under Distraction</h2>
    <p>Type while music plays, or simulate distractions. This helps build focus and error resistance in everyday situations.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use headphones and a timer to keep sessions short but impactful.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Day 7 – Final Test and Reflect</h2>
    <p>Retake your typing test from Day 1. Note your progress in WPM and accuracy. Celebrate the wins and identify areas to continue improving.</p>
    <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> You’ve completed a full week of typing discipline — the hard part is done!</p>
