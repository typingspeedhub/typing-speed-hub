  <p>Want to boost your typing performance quickly? This 7-day typing plan focuses on consistency, accuracy, and confidence. Start today, and by the end of the week, you'll see measurable progress. Need a focused daily warm-up? Try our <a href="10-minute-typing-drill.html">10-Minute Typing Drill</a>.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>📅 Day 1: Establish Your Baseline</h3>
    <p>Take a typing test to determine your current Words Per Minute (WPM) and accuracy. Record the results so you can compare them later.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>📚 Day 2: Learn Proper Finger Placement</h3>
    <p>Review the finger chart and focus on home-row keys. Avoid looking at the keyboard. Let your fingers start building muscle memory.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>⌨️ Day 3: Practice with Short Sentences</h3>
    <p>Type easy, everyday sentences slowly and accurately. Prioritize form over speed to build rhythm and flow.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>⏱ Day 4: Timed Typing Tests</h3>
    <p>Take multiple 1-minute typing tests. Compare them to your Day 1 score. Focus on staying calm while typing under pressure.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>🧠 Day 5: Learn to Type Common Words</h3>
    <p>Practice the most-used English words and word pairs (like “the”, “and”, “you”). Familiarity helps reduce hesitation during real writing.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>🎯 Day 6: Reduce Errors</h3>
    <p>Analyze previous mistakes — was it punctuation, hand placement, or rushing? Use today to work on your weak spots.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>🏁 Day 7: Final Test and Reflection</h3>
    <p>Take a final typing test. Compare your WPM and accuracy with Day 1. Celebrate your improvement — you earned it!</p>
  </section>

  <h2>✅ Summary</h2>
  <p>Typing faster isn't about rushing — it's about practicing smarter. This 7-day challenge helps you build solid habits, improve muscle memory, and stay motivated. Keep going beyond the week to see even bigger gains!</p>
