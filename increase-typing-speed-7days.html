  <h1>7-Day Plan to Increase Typing Speed and Accuracy</h1>

  <p>
    Looking to type faster <em>and</em> more accurately without spending hours every day? This
    focused 7-day plan is designed to give you a realistic boost in
    <strong>Words Per Minute (WPM)</strong> while building solid technique that will keep paying off
    long after the week is over.
  </p>

  <p>
    The routine works especially well if you currently type between
    <span class="highlight">15–50 WPM</span> and want a structured system instead of random tests.
    You’ll combine short practice blocks, accuracy training, and daily reflection — the same
    approach used by people who reach 60–80+ WPM over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before you start, it’s helpful to know your current level. You can quickly check it with our
    <a href="typing-speed-test.html">Typing Speed Test</a> or warm up first using the
    <a href="10-minute-typing-drill.html">10-Minute Typing Drill</a>.
  </p>

    <h2>How This 7-Day Typing Speed Plan Works</h2>
    <p>
      The goal isn’t to become a world-record typist in a week. Instead, this plan helps you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Build consistent daily typing habits</li>
      <li>Train proper finger placement and posture</li>
      <li>Increase WPM without sacrificing accuracy</li>
      <li>Identify and fix your most common mistakes</li>
      <li>Create a simple routine you can keep using after Day 7</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each day takes about <strong>15–25 minutes</strong>. If you can do more, great — but even this
      short schedule can lead to noticeable improvements when followed carefully.
    </p>

    <h2>Daily Routine – 7 Days to Faster Typing</h2>

    <div class="day-box">
      <h3>📅 Day 1: Take a Typing Benchmark Test</h3>
      <p>
        Start by measuring your current typing speed and accuracy. Take a 1-minute and a
        3-minute test using a site that shows both <strong>WPM</strong> and
        <strong>accuracy %</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Write your results down: WPM, accuracy, test length and language.</li>
        <li>Notice which keys or words feel slow or uncomfortable.</li>
        <li>Don’t worry if the numbers are low — this is just your starting point.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can log your results in a simple spreadsheet or notebook. Tracking progress is one of
        the strongest motivators to keep going.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="day-box">
      <h3>📚 Day 2: Master Home Row and Finger Placement</h3>
      <p>
        Good speed starts with consistent finger movement. Today you’ll focus on the
        <strong>home row keys (ASDF JKL;)</strong> and correct hand position.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Place your index fingers on <strong>F</strong> and <strong>J</strong> (the keys with bumps).</li>
        <li>Type patterns like <code>asdf jkl;</code>, <code>fj fj fj</code>, and <code>dad jkl</code> slowly.</li>
        <li>Keep your eyes on the screen, not the keyboard.</li>
        <li>Do 3–4 short rounds of 3 minutes each with small breaks in-between.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal isn’t speed yet — it’s <strong>clean, consistent movement</strong>. If you feel
        tension in your shoulders or wrists, shake your hands out and relax.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="day-box">
      <h3>✍️ Day 3: Type Simple Sentences Slowly</h3>
      <p>
        Now you’ll move from single keys to real words and phrases. This is where rhythm starts to
        develop.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Type short sentences like emails, chat messages, or journal notes.</li>
        <li>Focus on accuracy &mdash; aim for at least <strong>95–98% accuracy</strong>.</li>
        <li>Whenever you make a mistake, pause and re-type the entire word correctly.</li>
        <li>Spend 10–15 minutes doing this, then finish with one short speed test.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your test WPM is slightly lower than Day 1 but accuracy is higher, that’s still a win.
        You’re building the foundation for long-term progress.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="day-box">
      <h3>⏱ Day 4: Time-Based Typing Practice</h3>
      <p>
        Today the focus is on getting comfortable with short bursts of faster typing.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do <strong>three 1-minute typing tests</strong> with 1–2 minutes rest between them.</li>
        <li>Try to keep accuracy above 92–95% even when pushing the speed.</li>
        <li>Write down the best WPM and accuracy out of the three attempts.</li>
        <li>Afterward, type a slow 3-minute passage to cool down and reset technique.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many learners notice a small jump in WPM around this point. If your numbers look uneven
        from test to test, don’t worry — consistency will come with more practice.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="day-box">
      <h3>🔁 Day 5: Practice Common Words and Tricky Combos</h3>
      <p>
        A lot of everyday typing is made up of the same high-frequency words and letter
        combinations. Getting comfortable with them can boost your speed quickly.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make a list of frequent words such as
          <em>the, you, have, with, about, because, there, which</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice typing them in small groups, e.g.:
          <code>the you have</code>, <code>with about because</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add some tricky combos you often miss: <code>th</code>, <code>ou</code>, <code>gh</code>,
          <code>ion</code>, <code>ing</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Finish with a 2-minute test to see if these words feel smoother.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Over time, these words will feel almost automatic, freeing your brain to think about what
        you’re writing instead of which key to press next.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="day-box">
      <h3>🎯 Day 6: Analyze Mistakes and Target Weak Spots</h3>
      <p>
        Today is all about smart practice. Instead of more random tests, you’ll fix the things that
        slow you down the most.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Look back at your saved test results from Days 1–5.</li>
        <li>Circle the most common issues: missed letters, wrong hand, punctuation, numbers, etc.</li>
        <li>Create short drills that repeat your weak keys or patterns on purpose.</li>
        <li>Spend 10–15 minutes on these targeted drills, then take one relaxed test.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This kind of focused work is what separates people who stay stuck from those who keep
        improving week after week.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="day-box">
      <h3>🏁 Day 7: Retest and Reflect on Your Progress</h3>
      <p>
        Time to measure your progress! Try to recreate the conditions of Day 1 as closely as
        possible.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take the same <strong>1-minute and 3-minute tests</strong> you used on Day 1.</li>
        <li>Write your new WPM and accuracy next to your original scores.</li>
        <li>Note what feels different now: hand position, confidence, rhythm, fewer corrections.</li>
        <li>Set a new goal for the next month (for example: +5 WPM while keeping 95% accuracy).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Even if your WPM didn’t jump as much as you hoped, you’ve built habits and awareness that
        will keep paying off. Typing improvement is often a staircase: small plateaus followed by
        sudden steps up.
      </p>
    </div>

  <section>
    <h2>What Results Can You Expect After 7 Days?</h2>
    <p>
      Everyone starts from a different point, so results will vary. Many learners see an increase
      of <strong>5–15 WPM</strong> in their comfortable speed and a noticeable improvement in
      accuracy, especially if they were not using proper finger placement before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even more important than the raw numbers is the feeling that typing is becoming
      <strong>easier and more automatic</strong>. Your hands will know where to go, and you’ll spend
      less time correcting mistakes or searching for keys.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Tips to Keep Improving After the 7-Day Challenge</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Keep doing a <strong>short warm-up</strong> every day, like the
        <a href="10-minute-typing-drill.html">10-Minute Typing Drill</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use our <a href="typing-speed-test.html">Typing Speed Test</a> once or twice a week to track
        progress — not every few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Focus on accuracy first. When you can hit 97–99% accuracy comfortably, gently push for more
        speed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take short breaks to avoid fatigue. Tired hands and eyes lead to sloppy typing and bad
        habits.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want a broader routine that mixes drills, games and real-world practice, follow the
        <a href="7-day-typing-plan.html">7-Day Typing Plan</a> as your next step.
