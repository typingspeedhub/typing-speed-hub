  <p>Need a warm-up before starting? Try our <a href="10-minute-typing-drill.html">10-Minute Typing Drill</a> first.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>📅 Day 1: Take a Typing Benchmark Test</h3>
    <p>Begin by measuring your current typing speed and accuracy. Use a tool that reports WPM and error rate. Write down your results to track improvement throughout the week.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>📚 Day 2: Master Home Row and Finger Placement</h3>
    <p>Review basic finger positions for ASDF and JKL;. Practice drills that keep your fingers anchored on the home row. Focus on typing without looking at the keyboard.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>✍️ Day 3: Type Simple Sentences Slowly</h3>
    <p>Practice typing real-life phrases. Aim for precision, not speed. Use short prompts or daily journaling. This will build rhythm and reduce overcorrections.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>⏱ Day 4: Time-Based Typing Practice</h3>
    <p>Complete three 1-minute typing tests. Compare scores with Day 1. Notice where you improve or struggle. Stay relaxed to minimize stress-related mistakes.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>🔁 Day 5: Focus on Common Words and Pairs</h3>
    <p>Type high-frequency words like “the”, “you”, “are”, and “have”. Familiarity increases speed and eliminates hesitation during everyday typing tasks.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>🎯 Day 6: Analyze Mistakes and Target Weak Spots</h3>
    <p>Review previous test results. Were errors due to punctuation, finger misplacement, or rushing? Choose drills that reinforce your weakest areas.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>🏁 Day 7: Retest and Reflect on Your Progress</h3>
    <p>Take a final typing test. Compare your current WPM and accuracy with Day 1. Note improvements and set new goals for the future!</p>
