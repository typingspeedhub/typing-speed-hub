  <h1>Top 5 Common Typing Mistakes and How to Fix Them</h1>

  <p>
    Even experienced typists fall into small habits that quietly destroy accuracy and limit speed. If you feel like your typing
    isn’t improving (or you keep making the same errors), chances are you’re repeating one of a few common mistakes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The good news: these problems are <strong>fixable</strong> with targeted practice. If you want a quick routine that reinforces
    clean typing habits, try our <a href="10-minute-typing-drill.html">10-Minute Typing Drill</a>, or follow the
    <a href="7-day-typing-plan.html">7-Day Typing Plan</a> to build a stronger foundation over a week.
  </p>

  <h2>Before You Start: Speed vs. Accuracy</h2>
  <div class="step">
    <p>
      Many typists try to “push speed” and end up stuck. Real progress comes from this sequence:
      <strong>accuracy → consistency → speed</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="mini">Aim for 95%+ accuracy</span> in practice sessions.</li>
      <li>Type slightly slower than your maximum to keep your rhythm steady.</li>
      <li>Once mistakes drop, your WPM typically climbs naturally.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you want to understand speed metrics, read <a href="what-is-wpm.html">What is WPM?</a> and track your results using our
      <a href="index.html">Typing Speed Test</a>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>The 5 Most Common Typing Mistakes</h2>

  <section class="step">
    <h3>1. Looking at the Keyboard Too Often</h3>
    <p class="problem">❌ Problem: Glancing down breaks focus and prevents true muscle memory.</p>
    <p>
      When you look at the keyboard, your brain splits attention between keys and text. This often causes missed characters,
      extra backspaces, and inconsistent rhythm.
    </p>
    <p class="fix">✅ Fix: Train “eyes-on-screen” typing using small, repeatable drills.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with the home row (<code>ASDF JKL;</code>) and type slowly without looking down.</li>
      <li>Cover your hands with a light cloth for 2–3 minutes to remove the temptation.</li>
      <li>Use short sessions daily — consistency matters more than intensity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Tip: If your hands feel “lost,” slow down and reset your fingers to the home row rather than guessing.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="step">
    <h3>2. Inconsistent Finger Usage</h3>
    <p class="problem">❌ Problem: Using random fingers for the same key creates chaos and lowers accuracy.</p>
    <p>
      This is one of the biggest hidden mistakes. You might still type “fast,” but your fingers don’t develop reliable paths.
      The result is frequent errors, hesitation, and plateaus.
    </p>
    <p class="fix">✅ Fix: Use touch typing rules consistently (same key = same finger).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Commit to correct finger mapping for at least 7 days (even if it feels slower).</li>
      <li>Practice problem keys in small sets (e.g., <code>r t f g</code> or <code>i o k l</code>).</li>
      <li>If you keep missing one letter, isolate it: type a short list of words that include it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For a structured approach, follow the <a href="7-day-typing-plan.html">7-Day Typing Plan</a> and focus on technique first.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="step">
    <h3>3. Poor Posture and Tension</h3>
    <p class="problem">❌ Problem: Slouching, bent wrists, and tense shoulders lead to fatigue and more mistakes.</p>
    <p>
      Typing accuracy is not just a finger skill — it’s also comfort and control. If your shoulders are tight or wrists are bent,
      you’ll tire quickly and your keystrokes become less precise.
    </p>
    <p class="fix">✅ Fix: Make your setup comfortable and keep your hands relaxed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sit upright with your elbows close to your body (not flared out).</li>
      <li>Keep wrists neutral (not resting heavily on the desk).</li>
      <li>Take a 20–30 second break every 10 minutes (shake hands out, relax shoulders).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If your keyboard feels uncomfortable, consider reading <a href="best-keyboards-typing-practice.html">Best Keyboards for Typing</a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="step">
    <h3>4. Chasing Speed Instead of Accuracy</h3>
    <p class="problem">❌ Problem: Rushing creates errors, breaks rhythm, and reduces your real WPM.</p>
    <p>
      Many typing tests reward speed psychologically, but real-world typing rewards clean output. If you type fast with many
      corrections, your effective speed drops and frustration rises.
    </p>
    <p class="fix">✅ Fix: Use an “accuracy-first” rule before increasing pace.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pick a comfortable speed where you stay above <strong>95% accuracy</strong>.</li>
      <li>Increase speed gradually (small jumps), not by forcing it.</li>
      <li>Use short practice formats like the <a href="10-minute-typing-drill.html">10-Minute Typing Drill</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you need help balancing accuracy and speed, read <a href="typing-accuracy-tips.html">Typing Accuracy Tips</a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="step">
    <h3>5. Not Reviewing Mistakes (No Feedback Loop)</h3>
    <p class="problem">❌ Problem: If you never analyze errors, you repeat them for months.</p>
    <p>
      The fastest improvers don’t just “type more.” They notice patterns — specific letters, punctuation, or transitions that cause
      mistakes — then train those weak spots directly.
    </p>
    <p class="fix">✅ Fix: Track error patterns and practice them intentionally.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>After a test, write down your top 3 frequent mistakes (letters, words, punctuation).</li>
      <li>Create a short drill using those patterns for 2–3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Retest after your drill and compare results.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can track progress by regularly using our <a href="index.html">Typing Speed Test</a> and focusing on both WPM and accuracy.
    </p>

  <h2>A Simple “Fix Your Mistakes” Routine (10 Minutes)</h2>
  <div class="step">
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Warm-up (2 min):</strong> Home row + slow typing, eyes on screen.</li>
      <li><strong>Accuracy drill (3 min):</strong> Type carefully; aim for near-perfect accuracy.</li>
      <li><strong>Speed burst (3 min):</strong> Short timed test, but don’t sacrifice accuracy.</li>
      <li><strong>Review (2 min):</strong> Note your top mistakes and practice them once more.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This is similar to our <a href="10-minute-typing-drill.html">10-Minute Typing Drill</a> — a fast daily routine that prevents burnout.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Conclusion: Fix Mistakes, Then Speed Follows</h2>
  <p>
    Every fast typist was once a beginner. The difference is that good typists build clean habits and correct problems early.
    If you eliminate these five mistakes, you’ll feel typing become smoother, more confident, and naturally faster.
