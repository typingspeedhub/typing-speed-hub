  <h1>Top Typing Tips for Speed and Accuracy</h1>

  <p>Typing fast and accurately isn’t about rushing – it’s about building smart habits. Whether you're just starting out or trying to level up, these essential tips will help you sharpen your skills, avoid common mistakes, and stay on track with your typing goals.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Quick Typing Habits to Build</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Keep your fingers on the home row (ASDF – JKL;)</li>
      <li>✅ Don’t look at the keyboard — train your muscle memory</li>
      <li>✅ Practice daily, even if just 10 minutes</li>
      <li>✅ Focus on accuracy first — speed comes with confidence</li>
      <li>✅ Use all 10 fingers, not just index and thumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Typing Mistakes and Fixes</h2>
    <p>Many learners fall into similar traps when learning to type. Here’s how to fix them effectively:</p>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <h3>1. Looking at the Keyboard</h3>
      <p><strong>Why it’s bad:</strong> It slows you down and weakens memory.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix it:</strong> Use on-screen guides and cover your hands. Force your fingers to learn by position.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <h3>2. Using Only a Few Fingers</h3>
      <p><strong>Why it’s bad:</strong> Creates imbalanced technique and slower typing.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix it:</strong> Use tools that train all ten fingers properly — even if it feels slow at first.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <h3>3. Focusing Only on Speed</h3>
      <p><strong>Why it’s bad:</strong> Speed without accuracy leads to more backspace use — which slows you more.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix it:</strong> Target 95%+ accuracy. Once accuracy improves, your speed will naturally rise.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <h3>4. Poor Posture</h3>
      <p><strong>Why it’s bad:</strong> Bad ergonomics cause fatigue, pain, and mental fog.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix it:</strong> Sit upright, keep wrists neutral, and ensure your screen is eye-level.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Track Your Progress Weekly</h2>
    <p>Seeing improvement helps motivation. Use online typing test tools to log your:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Words per Minute (WPM)</li>
      <li>Accuracy rate (%)</li>
      <li>Time spent practicing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Set small goals like "+5 WPM" each week to stay consistent and challenged.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h2>Typing Games That Actually Work</h2>
  <p>Typing doesn’t have to be boring. In fact, some of the best progress happens when you’re having fun. Typing games combine repetition with real-time challenge, helping you build muscle memory and improve focus without feeling like “practice.”</p>
  <p><strong>Keybr</strong> is great for raw speed and accuracy. It generates random words that force your brain to stay alert, and it adapts to your weakest keys over time.</p>
  <p><strong>NitroType</strong> adds competition — race other users by typing passages accurately and quickly. It’s ideal for pushing your speed limits in short bursts.</p>
  <p><strong>TypeTastic</strong> is a fun, colorful option especially good for kids and beginners. It uses game-style levels to teach the keyboard layout gradually.</p>
  <p>For best results, mix 5–10 minutes of gaming with structured drills each day. Games help with reflexes and engagement, while traditional practice reinforces form and consistency.</p>
