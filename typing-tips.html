  <h2>Common Typing Mistakes and How to Fix Them</h2>

  <p>Whether you're a beginner or someone trying to improve your typing speed, certain mistakes tend to appear over and over again. Recognizing these issues early on can help you become a faster, more accurate typist.</p>

  <h2>1. Looking at the Keyboard</h2>
  <p>‚ùå <strong>Why it‚Äôs a problem:</strong> This slows you down and makes it harder to develop true muscle memory.</p>
  <p>‚úÖ <strong>Fix it:</strong> Practice touch typing with home-row based lessons (ASDF ‚Äì JKL;) and cover your hands if necessary. Use typing tools that provide on-screen keyboard guidance.</p>

  <h2>2. Using Only a Few Fingers</h2>
  <p>‚ùå <strong>Why it‚Äôs a problem:</strong> Limits your speed and puts more strain on specific fingers.</p>
  <p>‚úÖ <strong>Fix it:</strong> Follow finger charts and typing programs that teach all ten fingers. It may be slow at first, but it builds balanced muscle memory.</p>

  <h2>3. Prioritizing Speed Over Accuracy</h2>
  <p>‚ùå <strong>Why it‚Äôs a problem:</strong> Mistakes require corrections that cost more time than typing slowly and accurately.</p>
  <p>‚úÖ <strong>Fix it:</strong> Set a goal for 95%+ accuracy. Speed will improve naturally as accuracy becomes second nature.</p>

  <h2>4. Poor Posture</h2>
  <p>‚ùå <strong>Why it‚Äôs a problem:</strong> Leads to fatigue and long-term discomfort, affecting your focus and typing flow.</p>
  <p>‚úÖ <strong>Fix it:</strong> Sit up straight with wrists hovering slightly above the keyboard. Keep feet flat and shoulders relaxed.</p>
