  <h1>5 Typing Tips for Beginners</h1>
  <p>Learning to type faster and more accurately is one of the best skills you can build — whether you're a student, freelancer, or office worker. Here are five practical tips to help you get started:</p>
  <h2>1. Focus on Accuracy First</h2>
  <p>Don’t worry about speed in the beginning. Concentrate on hitting the right keys. Once accuracy becomes second nature, speed will naturally follow.</p>
  <h2>2. Practice a Little Every Day</h2>
  <p>Typing is like learning an instrument. Just 5–10 minutes a day is enough to build muscle memory over time.</p>
  <h2>3. Use All Your Fingers</h2>
  <p>Try to keep your fingers on the home row (ASDF / JKL;) and avoid "hunt-and-peck" typing. It might feel slower at first, but it pays off in the long run.</p>
  <h2>4. Look at the Screen, Not the Keyboard</h2>
  <p>This is key to touch typing. Force yourself to look only at the screen — even if you make mistakes at first.</p>
  <h2>5. Track Your Progress</h2>
  <p>Use typing tests (like the ones on this site) to measure your WPM and accuracy over time. It's motivating to see your improvement!</p>
