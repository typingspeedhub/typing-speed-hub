  <h1>Typing Tips</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Keep your fingers on the home row.</li>
    <li>✅ Don't look at the keyboard.</li>
    <li>✅ Practice daily for steady improvement.</li>
    <li>✅ Focus on accuracy before speed.</li>
    <li>✅ Use all 10 fingers while typing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Typing Mistakes and How to Fix Them</h2>
  <p>Whether you're a beginner or someone trying to improve your typing speed, certain mistakes tend to appear over and over again. Recognizing these issues early on can help you become a faster, more accurate typist.</p>

  <h2>1. Looking at the Keyboard</h2>
  <p><strong>❌ Why it’s a problem:</strong> This slows you down and makes it harder to develop true muscle memory.</p>
  <p><strong>✅ Fix it:</strong> Practice touch typing with home-row based lessons (ASDF – JKL;) and cover your hands if necessary. Use typing tools that provide on-screen keyboard guidance.</p>

  <h2>2. Incorrect Finger Placement</h2>
  <p><strong>❌ Why it’s a problem:</strong> Using the wrong fingers for certain keys causes awkward hand movements and fatigue.</p>
  <p><strong>✅ Fix it:</strong> Learn and follow the standard finger-key mapping. Repetition and drills are key.</p>

  <h2>3. Skipping Punctuation and Capitalization</h2>
  <p><strong>❌ Why it’s a problem:</strong> You might type fast, but skipping punctuation or caps makes your writing sloppy — especially in real-world scenarios.</p>
  <p><strong>✅ Fix it:</strong> Make sure to include punctuation and proper case when practicing. Use full-sentence typing tests that reflect real-world writing.</p>

  <h2>4. Rushing Through Practice</h2>
  <p><strong>❌ Why it’s a problem:</strong> Typing fast with many errors isn’t real progress. Speed without accuracy leads to bad habits.</p>
  <p><strong>✅ Fix it:</strong> Slow down. Focus first on accuracy, then build up speed gradually. Use tools that measure WPM and accuracy together.</p>

  <h2>5. Inconsistent Practice</h2>
  <p><strong>❌ Why it’s a problem:</strong> Typing is a muscle skill — and muscles need consistent repetition.</p>
  <p><strong>✅ Fix it:</strong> Create a daily habit: even 5–10 minutes a day is better than none. Consistency beats intensity.</p>

  <h2>Final Tip: Track Your Progress</h2>
  <p>Use a typing tool (like Typing Speed Hub!) that gives feedback over time. Celebrate improvements in WPM, but don’t ignore error rate.</p>
