  <h1>What Is WPM? Understanding Typing Speed & How to Improve It</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>WPM</strong> stands for <strong>Words Per Minute</strong> — the standard measurement used to determine how quickly a person can type.
    It represents how many “words” you type in one minute, using a consistent scoring method so results are fair and comparable across tests.
  </p>

  <p>
    Typing speed matters more today than ever. Whether you're a programmer writing code, a student completing assignments, a content creator,
    or simply someone who communicates online every day, improving your WPM can save time and reduce effort across everything you do.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h2>💡 How Is WPM Calculated?</h2>

    <p>
      Although typing tests seem simple, the calculation behind WPM is extremely standardized. Most professional typing platforms use this formula:
    </p>

    <div class="step">
      <p><strong>WPM = (Total Characters Typed ÷ 5) ÷ Time (minutes)</strong></p>
      <p>
        The “5-character word” definition avoids complications caused by long or short English words.
        For example, <code>cat</code> and <code>elephant</code> are treated equally during scoring.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h3>Example Calculation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>In 1 minute, you type 300 characters.</li>
        <li>Based on the 5-character rule: 300 ÷ 5 = 60 words.</li>
        <li>Your typing speed is: <strong>60 WPM</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Some tests also include error penalties. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gross WPM</strong> — speed before subtracting mistakes</li>
      <li><strong>Net WPM</strong> — speed after subtracting incorrect keystrokes</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
      On TypingSpeedHub, you’ll typically see both <strong>WPM</strong> and <strong>Accuracy</strong>,
      giving a clearer and more realistic picture of your skill level.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>📌 Why Is WPM Important?</h2>

    <p>
      Your typing speed directly affects your productivity in nearly every digital task. A higher WPM allows you to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Complete writing tasks faster with less effort</li>
      <li>Reduce mental load when typing long texts or code</li>
      <li>Communicate clearly and professionally</li>
      <li>Avoid mistakes caused by rushing</li>
      <li>Boost workplace or academic efficiency</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Typing faster isn’t just about speed — it’s about creating a smoother workflow.
      When typing becomes second nature, you free your brain to focus on ideas rather than keystrokes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>📊 What Is a Good Typing Speed?</h2>

    <p>
      Typing speed varies depending on experience, habits, and profession. Here’s a helpful benchmark:
    </p>

    <div class="step">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Beginner:</strong> 10–30 WPM</li>
        <li><strong>Average:</strong> 35–55 WPM</li>
        <li><strong>Above average:</strong> 55–75 WPM</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> 75–100 WPM</li>
        <li><strong>Expert:</strong> 100+ WPM</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      If you’re around <strong>40 WPM</strong>, you’re already in a solid range — and with consistent practice,
      you can improve faster than you think.
    </p>

    <h2>⚡ How to Improve Your WPM (Without Losing Accuracy)</h2>

    <p>
      The fastest way to improve isn’t “typing harder” — it’s training smarter. Here are proven ways to boost WPM:
    </p>

    <div class="step">
      <h3>1) Build accuracy first</h3>
      <p>
        Aim for <strong>95–98% accuracy</strong>. Speed comes naturally after your fingers stop making frequent errors.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h3>2) Practice in short daily sessions</h3>
      <p>
        Consistency beats intensity. A focused <strong>10 minutes per day</strong> outperforms an hour once a week.
        Try our routine here: <a href="10-minute-typing-drill.html">10-Minute Typing Drill</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h3>3) Fix your most common mistakes</h3>
      <p>
        Notice which letters, bigrams (<code>th</code>, <code>ing</code>), or punctuation trips you up.
        Drill those specifically instead of repeating random tests.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h3>4) Use proper posture + home-row habits</h3>
      <p>
        Small form issues create speed ceilings. Keep wrists neutral, shoulders relaxed, and use the correct fingers
        (touch typing) so you don’t “hunt and peck” under pressure.
      </p>
    </div>
