  <h1>What is WPM and What’s a Good Typing Speed?</h1>
  <p><strong>WPM</strong> stands for <em>Words Per Minute</em>, and it’s the standard unit used to measure typing speed. One “word” is typically calculated as 5 characters, including spaces and punctuation.</p>
  <h2>Why does WPM matter?</h2>
  <p>Your WPM reflects how efficiently you can type — especially important for students, office workers, writers, programmers, and anyone who uses a keyboard regularly.</p>
  <h2>What is a good WPM?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Beginner:</strong> 20–30 WPM</li>
    <li><strong>Average:</strong> 40–60 WPM</li>
    <li><strong>Proficient:</strong> 60–80 WPM</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced / Professional:</strong> 80–100+ WPM</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Is speed or accuracy more important?</h2>
  <p>Accuracy always comes first. Speed will naturally increase as you practice typing correctly. If you type fast but constantly make mistakes, you’ll lose time correcting them — which defeats the purpose.</p>
  <h2>How to improve your WPM</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Practice 5–10 minutes daily</li>
    <li>Focus on accuracy before trying to speed up</li>
    <li>Use tools that track your progress and make it fun (like the typing tests on this site)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>With regular practice and the right mindset, most people can significantly increase their WPM in just a few weeks!</p>
