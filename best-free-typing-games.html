<h2>⚖️ Typing Games vs Typing Tests — Which Should You Use?</h2>

<div class="step">
  <p>
    Typing games are great for motivation and habit building, but they should not fully replace
    structured tests and drills.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Typing games:</strong> motivation, rhythm, consistency</li>
    <li><strong>Typing tests:</strong> measurable WPM and accuracy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The best approach is to combine both.
    Use games to stay engaged, and tests like the
    <a href="index.html">Typing Speed Test</a> to track progress objectively.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>👶 Are Typing Games Suitable for Kids?</h2>

<div class="step">
  <p>
    Yes! Typing games are especially effective for children because they turn learning into play.
    Many platforms offer simplified visuals and age-appropriate challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
